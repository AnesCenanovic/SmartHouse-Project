Quick C# and .NET project meant to simulate a SmartHouse module with various devices, rooms, security features, mood and aesthetics management, power usage, and logging, among other things.

A house consists primarily of rooms, each of which can hold different interactable devices. Preset room types allow the user to create a unique home.

Devices have several features unique to each one, though some are quite similar. They're tied to the rooms they're in, and each can either be controlled individually or in a group through moods.

This can easily be expanded upon to allow the user to create custom moods.

A security system involving password hashing is mainly implemented through lock devices, that are also tied to the room they're in.

A logging system allows for some sort of data persistence in the form of .txt files.

The whole project is very modular and can easily be extended with new rooms, devices, moods, security features and more.
